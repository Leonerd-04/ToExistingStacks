# ToExistingStacks
A client-side Minecraft mod that implements the "Add to Existing Stacks" button from Stardew Valley for inventory management.

Basically, it will move any stack of items of type X from your inventory to a container that you have opened, as long as that container already has a stack of item X in it, whenever the mod's keybind is pressed.
This also works on most screens with item slots, like furnaces and crafting menus.

To run ToExistingStacks, you will need Minecraft 1.18-1.19, Fabric Loader, and the Fabric API.

*Note:* This mod is client-side only, meaning you can connect to servers while using it. However, this mod acts a lot like a macro (to the server, it looks like you're shift-clicking a bunch of times really quickly), and may get you banned if used on certain servers.
*Please be careful using this mod in multiplayer. Only use it on servers you can be certain will be okay with it.*
